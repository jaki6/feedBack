"""Text-matching engine for MusicBrainz metadata enrichment (P8).

Pure functions only — no network, no database, no server imports — so the
whole matching pipeline is unit-testable in isolation. server.py owns the
throttled HTTP transport and the song_enrichment writes; this module owns:

* denoise/tokenize: fold community chart-title noise (author suffixes,
  ``(440Hz)``/``(Live)``/``(No Lead)``/``(v2)`` parentheticals, punctuation,
  diacritics, ``AC DC``/``ACDC``/``AC/DC`` spelling drift) into a comparable
  token form,
* similarity + scoring: token-set similarity on artist+title with year and
  duration proximity as corroborating bonuses,
* tier classification: auto (high) / review (medium) / none (low) — the
  design rule is that a WRONG match is worse than no match, so the auto
  tier is deliberately strict and medium confidence goes to a human,
* MusicBrainz JSON parsing: normalize ``/ws/2`` recording documents into
  the flat candidate dicts the review UI and song_enrichment store.
