![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-fee%5BdB%5Dack-darkblue)

A FeedBack (fee[dB]ack) plugin that organizes your `.sloppak` / `.feedpak` DLC songs into a folder tree, grouped by the folders on disk. Browse your whole library visually with album art, nest folders as deep as you like, switch between list and grid layouts, and manage folders without ever leaving the app.

> **Status — migrating to core.** Folder Library is being reworked from a standalone plugin into a bundled core plugin, and several previously-shipped features are not currently wired up in core (see the Roadmap). The list below reflects what works today; if something here is wrong, it's because this rework is still in progress.

## Features

- **List & Grid views** — toggle between a compact list with thumbnails or a full album art card grid
- **Album art** — pulls art automatically for every song in both views
- **One-click playback** — click any song to start playing immediately
- **Sort options** — sort songs by title, artist, duration, year, tuning, or recently added with an asc/desc toggle
- **Advanced filters** — filter by arrangements, stems, lyrics, and tuning with include and exclude support
- **Folder management** — create, rename, and delete folders without leaving the plugin
- **Nested subfolders** — organize as deep as you want; create a subfolder inside any folder, expand/collapse a whole branch in one click
- **Collapsible folders** — expand/collapse individual folders, plus Expand All / Collapse All
- **Move songs** — reassign any song to a different folder on the fly; press `Esc` to cancel
- **Drag-and-drop** — drag songs between folders (including into nested folders) with smooth auto-scroll; press `Esc` to cancel
- **Fast with big libraries** — folder song lists render lazily and metadata is cached so reopening folders is instant

## Installation

Folder Library ships bundled with FeedBack as a core plugin (`"bundled": true`), so there's nothing to install — the **Folders** screen appears in the navbar under **Plugins** automatically.

## Changelog

Folder Library started life as a standalone plugin with its own version line, but it's now a **bundled core plugin** that ships with FeedBack. Its changes are tracked alongside the app in the repo-root [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md), and it versions with the app rather than on its own. The **Features** section above reflects what's in the current build.
